        # Vernam 1.1.5
        
        ### Synopsis
        A simple vernam (or OTP) encryption / decription program in python
        
        ---
        ### Code Example
        Create an object with plaintext "abcd6z":
        ~~~
        >>> foo = vernam("abcd6z
        ~~~
        ---
        Encrypt with key "abczz", store in variable "encoded", and print:
        ~~~
        >>> encoded = (foo.xor("abczz"))
        >>> print( encoded )
        [u'\x00', u'\x00', u'\x00', u'\x1e', u'L', u'\x1b']
        ~~~
        ---
        Create object with ciphertext stored in "encoded":
        ~~~
        >>> bar = vernam(encoded)
        ~~~
        ---
        Decrypt with key "abczz", store in variable "decoded", and print (with list joined):
        ~~~
        >>> decoded = bar.xor("abczz")
        >>> print( "".join(decoded) )
        abcd6z
        ~~~
        ---
        ### Installation
        Install:
        ~~~
        >>> pip install vernam
        ~~~
        ---
        Import:
        ~~~
        >>> from vernam import vernam
        ~~~
        ---
        ### API Reference
        1. Create an instance of class vernam
        2. Run: 
        instance.xor(key)
          * "key" must be a string or list, if the latter, each item must contain a single unicode character in string form
